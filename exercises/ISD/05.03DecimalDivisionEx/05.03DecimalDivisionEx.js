/*Now we try out how decimal division works. 
See how many decimals the system includes in the quotient. ('quotient' = the number that results when one number is divided by another).
Define the following two variables: a and b. Assign 4.87 to a and 5.03 to b. 
After that, write the quotient of a and b into the browser console.*/

var a = 4.87;
b = 5.03;
console.log(a/b);
